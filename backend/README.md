This project is built on React as a frontend and Django rest framework api as a backend application.

## Project Build Process

The front end application is done with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app).
Resides in the frontend directory.

Using [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/documenting-your-api/) as the backend with simpleJWT, run the APIs on port [8000](http://localhost:8000)

Database used for the application is [Postgres](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
